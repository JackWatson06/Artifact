# Artifact

Artifact is a two dimensional platformer about an Alien named Squish exploring a newly discovered world. Your goal is to collect an array of different artifacts from the newly discover world. Artifact was programmed entirely using the Java programming language, and the art for Artifact was creating using a basic pixel editor allowing me to do complex pixelated sprites.
